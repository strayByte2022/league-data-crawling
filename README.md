**What's for?** : Fun

**What's next?**: IDK, ping if me you know anything useful with this.

**Version**: Maybe beta of beta, haven't even made it a GUI (too lz).

**Feedback**: Would like to receive any fun ideas with those dull stats.

**How to run it?**: Run mainUI.py for finding summoner's profile data.
